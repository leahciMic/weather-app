# Weather app

This weather app was built for a coding challenge.

You can test it out like:

* http://weather-leahcimic.herokuapp.com/weather/Sydney
* http://weather-leahcimic.herokuapp.com/weather/1-3+Smail+St+Ultiimo (you can enter any location name, and it will try and make sense of it).

It's a quick Express app using Jade templates. I had a lot more in mind, but have not completed everything yet.

It uses Redis for caching.
